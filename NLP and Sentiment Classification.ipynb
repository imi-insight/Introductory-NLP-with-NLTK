      "      thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was\r\n",
      "      still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt\r\n",
      "      himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\r\n",
      "      not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\r\n",
      "      seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her\r\n",

      "      They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a\r\n",
      "      while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where\r\n",
      "      the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many\r\n",
      "      charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long\r\n",
      "      range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the\r\n",
      "      stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole\r\n",
      "      park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant\r\n",
      "      smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the\r\n",
      "      matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought\r\n",
      "      them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to\r\n",
      "      the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They\r\n",
      "      crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air\r\n",
      "      of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet\r\n",
      "      visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed\r\n",
      "      room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough\r\n",
      "      coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its\r\n",
      "      windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived\r\n",
      "      their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great\r\n",
      "      walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the\r\n",
      "      carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore,\r\n",
      "      obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on\r\n",
      "      the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but\r\n",
      "      their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to\r\n",
      "      indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much\r\n",
      "      engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in\r\n",
      "      the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced\r\n",

      "      again surprised, and Elizabethâs astonishment was quite equal to\r\n",
      "      what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching\r\n",
      "      them, and at no great distance. The walk here being here less\r\n",
      "      sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\r\n",
      "      they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more\r\n",
      "      prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and\r\n",
      "      to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a\r\n",
      "      few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into\r\n",
      "      some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk\r\n",
      "      concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was\r\n",
      "      immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost\r\n",
      "      none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she\r\n",
      "      began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she\r\n",
      "      had not got beyond the words âdelightful,â and âcharming,â when\r\n",
      "      some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise\r\n",
      "      of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her\r\n",
      "      colour changed, and she said no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,\r\n",
      "      he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to\r\n",
      "      her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was\r\n",
      "      quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his\r\n",
      "      being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people\r\n",
      "      against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself.\r\n",
      "      âWhat will be his surprise,â thought she, âwhen he knows who they\r\n",

      "      That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he\r\n",
      "      sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going\r\n",
      "      away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with\r\n",

      "      attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\r\n",

      "      often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood,\r\n",
      "      offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and\r\n",
      "      pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually\r\n",
      "      most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with\r\n",
      "      Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said\r\n",
      "      nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be\r\n",
      "      all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\r\n",
      "      continually was she repeating, âWhy is he so altered? From what\r\n",
      "      can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_âit cannot be for _my_ sake\r\n",
      "      that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could\r\n",
      "      not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should\r\n",

      "      to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some\r\n",
      "      curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It\r\n",
      "      originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the\r\n",
      "      morning, found Elizabethâs arm inadequate to her support, and\r\n",
      "      consequently preferred her husbandâs. Mr. Darcy took her place by\r\n",

      "      the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been\r\n",
      "      assured of his absence before she came to the place, and\r\n",
      "      accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very\r\n",
      "      unexpectedââfor your housekeeper,â she added, âinformed us that\r\n",
      "      you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed,\r\n",
      "      before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not\r\n",

      "      of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned\r\n",
      "      his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with\r\n",
      "      whom he had been travelling. âThey will join me early to-morrow,â\r\n",
      "      he continued, âand among them are some who will claim an\r\n",

      "      Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were\r\n",
      "      instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingleyâs name had\r\n",
      "      been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by\r\n",
      "      his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "      They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\r\n",

      "      flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her\r\n",
      "      was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the\r\n",

      "      He then asked her to walk into the houseâbut she declared herself\r\n",
      "      not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time\r\n",
      "      much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She\r\n",
      "      wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every\r\n",

      "      replied her aunt, âbut it is confined to his air, and is not\r\n",
      "      unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some\r\n",

      "      âI was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was\r\n",
      "      more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no\r\n",
      "      necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was\r\n",

      "      âFrom what we have seen of him,â continued Mrs. Gardiner, âI\r\n",

      "      cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not\r\n",
      "      an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing\r\n",

      "      Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life\r\n",
      "      that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an\r\n",
      "      annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his\r\n",
      "      wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had\r\n",

      "      indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now\r\n",
      "      be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of\r\n",
      "      the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband\r\n",
      "      might then have rested in its proper place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to\r\n",
      "      anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his\r\n",
      "      brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out\r\n",
      "      the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as\r\n",
      "      soon as he could.\r\n",

      "      When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be\r\n",
      "      perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The\r\n",
      "      son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should\r\n",
      "      be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means\r\n",
      "      be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world,\r\n",
      "      but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years\r\n",
      "      after Lydiaâs birth, had been certain that he would. This event\r\n",
      "      had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be\r\n",
      "      saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husbandâs\r\n",
      "      love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\r\n",
      "      income.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.\r\n",
      "      Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be\r\n",
      "      divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.\r\n",
      "      This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now\r\n",
      "      to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in\r\n",
      "      acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful\r\n",
      "      acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed\r\n",
      "      most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\r\n",
      "      approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil\r\n",
      "      the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before\r\n",
      "      supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his\r\n",
      "      daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to\r\n",
      "      himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten\r\n",
      "      pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them;\r\n",
      "      for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual\r\n",
      "      presents in money which passed to her through her motherâs hands,\r\n",
      "      Lydiaâs expenses had been very little within that sum.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,\r\n",
      "      too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present\r\n",
      "      was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When\r\n",
      "      the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in\r\n",
      "      seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former\r\n",
      "      indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory\r\n",
      "      in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged\r\n",
      "      to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his\r\n",
      "      brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      The good news spread quickly through the house, and with\r\n",
      "      proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in\r\n",
      "      the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been\r\n",
      "      more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come\r\n",
      "      upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded\r\n",
      "      from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to\r\n",
      "      be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her\r\n",
      "      well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old\r\n",

      "      this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,\r\n",
      "      and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a\r\n",
      "      damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been\r\n",
      "      the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on\r\n",
      "      the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran\r\n",
      "      wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new\r\n",
      "      carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the\r\n",
      "      neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and,\r\n",
      "      without knowing or considering what their income might be,\r\n",
      "      rejected many as deficient in size and importance.\r\n",

      "      but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "      Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\r\n",

      "      A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was\r\n",

      "      amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea\r\n",

       "'The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon, who I\\'ve had a crush on since 9th grade, which was his first year on SNL. I am a die-hard Yankees fan, and I didn\\'t find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes, when they begin showing clips of the ALCS games. I had to cover my ears and make small noises so I wouldn\\'t have to hear that which must not be heard, but otherwise it was completely bearable.<br /><br />I thought Jimmy played the role very well, because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky, and he is a nervous and quirky guy. I know that it may not be a Academy Award-winning stretch, but the movie is just a light, fun, romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see.<br /><br />Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him, and thank goodness, because Taxi could have killed it. I think Fever Pitch will help him out a lot. Everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies. I imagine it must be difficult, and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc) you\\'ll see that they started off in some flops. Busom Buddies? Australian soap operas? Here\\'s wishing Jimmy a successful career on screen. I never wanted him to leave SNL but what can you do?This was a great film in every sense of the word. It tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm. It criticises a great many Indian customs that many find oppressive -- such as the arranging of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, the valuation of women in terms of their baby-making capacity, the binding concepts of duty and so on. At the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagonists find themselves. The film is well-acted and genuine, completely believable from beginning to end, unlike most Bollywood flicks. The main faults of the film as I saw it was first, that the two lovers seem drawn to one another not necessarily by a natural affinity for each other as much as the fact that they are stuck in dead-end marriages with no passion and no rewards. This may play a part in the sexual awakening of the characters, but most people stuck in the same situation will not \"turn homosexual\". It seems clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are quite heterosexual -- when Radha does her scene at the end of the movie with Aashok, she makes it quite clear that \"without desire she was dead\", and the implication was that if he had desired so, he could have fulfilled her quite completely, and also when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband seemed to not like her. Such situations do not turn people into homosexuals -- they may seek comfort in others in the same position, but inthe film it is not at all made clear that they are lesbians from the beginning -- quite the opposite. Some people are bisexual, it is true, but most tend to be either hetero- or homosexual. In the case of the ladies in the film, both had insensitive jerks for husbands . . . if this had not been the case, would they have naturally found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they may have otherwise not have considered? The film ignores this. The other fault is the naming of the characters . . . the names Sita and Radha seem contrived deliberately to shock and outrage (imagine a film in America depicting a gay relationship between a man named \"Jesus\" and another named \"Paul\"!) by using names associated with various Hindoo scriptures. The film is strong enough to stand on its own and needs no such devices in my opinion. At any rate, the faults do not take much away from the power of the movie. It is indeed a very touching and powerful story -- the images and characters will stay with you a long time after you leave the theatre.I enjoy watching people doing breakdance, especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called \"Roxy\". Especially at Christmas time, because there also appears a \"MC Santa Claus\".<br /><br />Even if this is an old film, and even if I have videotaped it from TV, when the State Movie Archive of Finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, I went there to check it out. It\\'s much more enjoyable on big screen than on TV.<br /><br />Even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost, I disagree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I got the money\\'s worth by seeing this, as it is on big screen, especially seated on front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience, and much better than just on video.Affable aspiring cartoonist Hoops McCann (a wonderfully engaging performance by John Cusack) and his best buddy George (the deliciously deadpan Joel Murray) go to Nantucket for the summer following graduation from high school. Hoops, George, and several newfound pals come to the aid of Cassandra (Demi Moore at her most charming), a singer who\\'s family house is being threatened with demolition by the greedy Beckersted clan. Writer/director Savage Steve Holland offers an often hilariously wacky and zesty nonstop barrage of admittedly broad and dumb, but still very funny jokes. The constant madcap lunacy has a real giddy, good-natured and infectiously inane vitality to it that\\'s impossible to either dislike or resist. Moreover, the lively and enthusiastic acting from a fine game cast adds immensely to the zany merriment: Bobcat Goldthwait as the spastic Egg Stork, Tom Villard as his goofy brother Clay, Curtis Armstrong as the sweet Ack Ack Raymond, Mark Metcalf as evil rich jerk Aquilla Beckersted, Matt Mulhern as the mean Teddy, Kimberly Foster as the fetching Cookie, Joe Flaherty as the gung-ho General Raymond, William Hickey as cranky Old Man Beckersted, Jeremy Piven as smug preppy bully Ty, and John Matuszak as hulking biker Stan. Isidore Mankofsky\\'s slick cinematography, the hip thrashy soundtrack, Cory Lerios\\' cool rockin\\' score, and the funky animation are all uniformly excellent. Single funniest scene: Egg in a Godzilla suit terrorizing a posh dinner party. An absolute hoot.I was half-dozing as I watched a late night selection of short films--but sat bolt upright from the first frames of \"I Shout Love\" and could not take my eyes away for its full, brief, perfect length. With incredibly assured pacing and performances, this film maintains its funny/sad/insightful tone throughout. The credits at the end went by so quickly and in such small type, I had to go online to find out the person responsible for this master work. What a pleasing surprise to see the name of Sarah Polley, a major actress who is too seldom seen.<br /><br />Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) turn in rich, touching performances as a couple in the throes of breaking up. As they work through a reprise of Tessa\\'s favorite moments from their time together, both actors reveal dimensions of their characters and their relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talents--and to the director/writer\\'s skills. The film creates a moving narrative with laugh-out-loud moments and caught-breath sorrow.<br /><br />\"I Shout Love\" is unquestionably one of the greatest and most memorable short films I ever expect to see. It has wit, heart and stunning originality. It matters.'"
