      "      “He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has\r\n",

      "      opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de\r\n",
      "      Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady\r\n",
      "      Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.\r\n",
      "      Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss\r\n",

      "      any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on\r\n",
      "      every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not\r\n",
      "      used to have her judgement controverted. She inquired into\r\n",

      "      hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her\r\n",

      "      lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of\r\n",
      "      dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.\r\n",

      "      it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My\r\n",
      "      objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last\r\n",

      "      aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so\r\n",

      "      must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother’s\r\n",

      "      a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was\r\n",
      "      instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite\r\n",
      "      side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.\r\n",
      "      It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising\r\n",
      "      ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front,\r\n",
      "      a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but\r\n",
      "      without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal\r\n",
      "      nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen\r\n",
      "      a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty\r\n",
      "      had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\r\n",

      "      well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after\r\n",
      "      slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.\r\n",
      "      The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving\r\n",

      "      Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the\r\n",
      "      whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the\r\n",
      "      winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with\r\n",

      "      taking different positions; but from every window there were\r\n",
      "      beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their\r\n",
      "      furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but\r\n",
      "      Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither\r\n",

      "      when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and\r\n",
      "      he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left\r\n",
      "      Longbourn, and of her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and\r\n",
      "      in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "      her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered\r\n",
      "      by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate,\r\n",
      "      the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must\r\n",
      "      appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so\r\n",
      "      vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself\r\n",
      "      in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come\r\n",
      "      a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes\r\n",
      "      sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\r\n",
      "      discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment\r\n",
      "      arrived—that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She\r\n",
      "      blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And\r\n",
      "      his behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could it mean? That he\r\n",
      "      should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak with such\r\n",
      "      civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she\r\n",
      "      seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with\r\n",
      "      such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast\r\n",
      "      did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his\r\n",
      "      letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\r\n",
      "      account for it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,\r\n",
      "      and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a\r\n",
      "      finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it\r\n",
      "      was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,\r\n",
      "      though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her\r\n",
      "      uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as\r\n",
      "      they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her\r\n",
      "      thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House,\r\n",
      "      whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to\r\n",
      "      know what at the moment was passing in his mind—in what manner he\r\n",
      "      thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was\r\n",
      "      still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt\r\n",
      "      himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\r\n",
      "      not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\r\n",
      "      seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her\r\n",
      "      with composure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence\r\n",
      "      of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more\r\n",
      "      like herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a\r\n",
      "      while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where\r\n",
      "      the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many\r\n",
      "      charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long\r\n",
      "      range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the\r\n",
      "      stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole\r\n",
      "      park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant\r\n",
      "      smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the\r\n",
      "      matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought\r\n",
      "      them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to\r\n",
      "      the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They\r\n",
      "      crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air\r\n",
      "      of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet\r\n",
      "      visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed\r\n",
      "      room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough\r\n",
      "      coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its\r\n",
      "      windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived\r\n",
      "      their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great\r\n",
      "      walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the\r\n",
      "      carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore,\r\n",
      "      obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on\r\n",
      "      the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but\r\n",
      "      their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to\r\n",
      "      indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much\r\n",
      "      engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in\r\n",
      "      the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced\r\n",
      "      but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were\r\n",
      "      again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was quite equal to\r\n",
      "      what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching\r\n",
      "      them, and at no great distance. The walk here being here less\r\n",
      "      sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\r\n",
      "      they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more\r\n",
      "      prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and\r\n",
      "      to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a\r\n",
      "      few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into\r\n",
      "      some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk\r\n",
      "      concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was\r\n",
      "      immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost\r\n",
      "      none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she\r\n",
      "      began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she\r\n",
      "      had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when\r\n",
      "      some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise\r\n",
      "      of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her\r\n",
      "      colour changed, and she said no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,\r\n",
      "      he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to\r\n",
      "      her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was\r\n",
      "      quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his\r\n",
      "      being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people\r\n",
      "      against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself.\r\n",
      "      “What will be his surprise,” thought she, “when he knows who they\r\n",
      "      are? He takes them now for people of fashion.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named\r\n",
      "      their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to\r\n",
      "      see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his\r\n",
      "      decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.\r\n",
      "      That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he\r\n",
      "      sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going\r\n",
      "      away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with\r\n",
      "      Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but\r\n",
      "      triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\r\n",
      "      relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\r\n",
      "      attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\r\n",
      "      expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his\r\n",
      "      intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.\r\n",
      "      Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as\r\n",
      "      often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood,\r\n",
      "      offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and\r\n",
      "      pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually\r\n",
      "      most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with\r\n",
      "      Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said\r\n",
      "      nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be\r\n",
      "      all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\r\n",
      "      continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what\r\n",
      "      can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_—it cannot be for _my_ sake\r\n",
      "      that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could\r\n",
      "      not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should\r\n",
      "      still love me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the\r\n",
      "      two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending\r\n",
      "      to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some\r\n",
      "      curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It\r\n",
      "      originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the\r\n",
      "      morning, found Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and\r\n",
      "      consequently preferred her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by\r\n",
      "      her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence,\r\n",
      "      the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been\r\n",
      "      assured of his absence before she came to the place, and\r\n",
      "      accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very\r\n",
      "      unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\r\n",
      "      you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed,\r\n",
      "      before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not\r\n",
      "      immediately expected in the country.” He acknowledged the truth\r\n",
      "      of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned\r\n",
      "      his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with\r\n",
      "      whom he had been travelling. “They will join me early to-morrow,”\r\n",
      "      he continued, “and among them are some who will claim an\r\n",
      "      acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were\r\n",
      "      instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had\r\n",
      "      been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by\r\n",
      "      his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      “There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after\r\n",
      "      a pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will\r\n",
      "      you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to\r\n",
      "      your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too\r\n",
      "      great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She\r\n",
      "      immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of\r\n",
      "      being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,\r\n",
      "      without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying\r\n",
      "      to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of\r\n",
      "      her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\r\n",
      "      Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was\r\n",
      "      flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her\r\n",
      "      was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the\r\n",
      "      others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.\r\n",
      "      Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself\r\n",
      "      not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time\r\n",
      "      much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She\r\n",
      "      wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every\r\n",
      "      subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling,\r\n",
      "      and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.\r\n",
      "      Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas\r\n",
      "      were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go\r\n",
      "      into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined,\r\n",
      "      and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy\r\n",
      "      handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off,\r\n",
      "      Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of\r\n",
      "      them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they\r\n",
      "      had expected. “He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and\r\n",
      "      unassuming,” said her uncle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      “There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,”\r\n",
      "      replied her aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not\r\n",
      "      unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some\r\n",
      "      people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      “I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was\r\n",
      "      more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no\r\n",
      "      necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was\r\n",
      "      very trifling.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      “To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as\r\n",
      "      Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his\r\n",
      "      features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he\r\n",
      "      was so disagreeable?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had\r\n",
      "      liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that\r\n",
      "      she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      “But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,”\r\n",
      "      replied her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I\r\n",
      "      shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\r\n",
      "      another day, and warn me off his grounds.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his\r\n",
      "      character, but said nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      “From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I\r\n",
      "      really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so\r\n",
      "      cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not\r\n",
      "      an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing\r\n",
      "      about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity\r\n",
      "      in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea\r\n",
      "      of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his\r\n",
      "      house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help\r\n",
      "      laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose,\r\n",
      "      and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in\r\n",
      "      vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them\r\n",
      "      to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what\r\n",
      "      she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were\r\n",
      "      capable of a very different construction; and that his character\r\n",
      "      was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham’s so amiable, as they had\r\n",
      "      been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she\r\n",
      "      related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in\r\n",
      "      which they had been connected, without actually naming her\r\n",
      "      authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\r\n",

      "      way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in\r\n",
      "      pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its\r\n",
      "      environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by\r\n",

      "      convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "      Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,\r\n",
      "      though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her\r\n",

      "      manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had\r\n",
      "      expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as\r\n",
      "      ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such\r\n",
      "      different feelings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that\r\n",

      "      to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when\r\n",
      "      Bingley’s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he\r\n",
      "      entered the room. All Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long\r\n",
      "      done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood\r\n",
      "      its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he\r\n",

      "      the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting\r\n",

      "      directed their observation towards each with an earnest though\r\n",
      "      guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full\r\n",
      "      conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of\r\n",
      "      the lady’s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that\r\n",
      "      the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "      Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain\r\n",
      "      the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "      In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister;\r\n",

      "      were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he\r\n",
      "      talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased\r\n",
      "      herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying\r\n",
      "      to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she\r\n",
      "      could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had\r\n",
      "      been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side\r\n",
      "      that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that\r\n",

      "      satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere\r\n",
      "      they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\r\n",
      "      recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of\r\n",

      "      all dancing together at Netherfield.”\r\n",

      "      not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there\r\n",
      "      was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.\r\n",

      "      It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy\r\n",
      "      himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an\r\n",

      "      heard an accent so removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his\r\n",

      "      which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence\r\n",

      "      their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage—the difference, the\r\n",
      "      change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she\r\n",

      "      even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his\r\n",

      "      considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though\r\n",

      "      to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and\r\n",
      "      aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "      But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity;\r\n",
      "      it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident\r\n",

      "      whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily\r\n",

      "      so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in\r\n",
      "      so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all,\r\n",
      "      above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of\r\n",

       "'The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon, who I\\'ve had a crush on since 9th grade, which was his first year on SNL. I am a die-hard Yankees fan, and I didn\\'t find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes, when they begin showing clips of the ALCS games. I had to cover my ears and make small noises so I wouldn\\'t have to hear that which must not be heard, but otherwise it was completely bearable.<br /><br />I thought Jimmy played the role very well, because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky, and he is a nervous and quirky guy. I know that it may not be a Academy Award-winning stretch, but the movie is just a light, fun, romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see.<br /><br />Jimmy and Drew worked well together, and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past. (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie? What?) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him, and thank goodness, because Taxi could have killed it. I think Fever Pitch will help him out a lot. Everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies. I imagine it must be difficult, and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc) you\\'ll see that they started off in some flops. Busom Buddies? Australian soap operas? Here\\'s wishing Jimmy a successful career on screen. I never wanted him to leave SNL but what can you do?This was a great film in every sense of the word. It tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm. It criticises a great many Indian customs that many find oppressive -- such as the arranging of marriages by others, the importance of status and face, religious hypocrisy, sexism, the valuation of women in terms of their baby-making capacity, the binding concepts of duty and so on. At the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagonists find themselves. The film is well-acted and genuine, completely believable from beginning to end, unlike most Bollywood flicks. The main faults of the film as I saw it was first, that the two lovers seem drawn to one another not necessarily by a natural affinity for each other as much as the fact that they are stuck in dead-end marriages with no passion and no rewards. This may play a part in the sexual awakening of the characters, but most people stuck in the same situation will not \"turn homosexual\". It seems clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are quite heterosexual -- when Radha does her scene at the end of the movie with Aashok, she makes it quite clear that \"without desire she was dead\", and the implication was that if he had desired so, he could have fulfilled her quite completely, and also when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband seemed to not like her. Such situations do not turn people into homosexuals -- they may seek comfort in others in the same position, but inthe film it is not at all made clear that they are lesbians from the beginning -- quite the opposite. Some people are bisexual, it is true, but most tend to be either hetero- or homosexual. In the case of the ladies in the film, both had insensitive jerks for husbands . . . if this had not been the case, would they have naturally found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they may have otherwise not have considered? The film ignores this. The other fault is the naming of the characters . . . the names Sita and Radha seem contrived deliberately to shock and outrage (imagine a film in America depicting a gay relationship between a man named \"Jesus\" and another named \"Paul\"!) by using names associated with various Hindoo scriptures. The film is strong enough to stand on its own and needs no such devices in my opinion. At any rate, the faults do not take much away from the power of the movie. It is indeed a very touching and powerful story -- the images and characters will stay with you a long time after you leave the theatre.I enjoy watching people doing breakdance, especially if they do it as well as in the best scenes of this movie which takes you to a disco club called \"Roxy\". Especially at Christmas time, because there also appears a \"MC Santa Claus\".<br /><br />Even if this is an old film, and even if I have videotaped it from TV, when the State Movie Archive of Finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, I went there to check it out. It\\'s much more enjoyable on big screen than on TV.<br /><br />Even if many people here think that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost, I disagree with this and I think that when I paid my ticket, I got the money\\'s worth by seeing this, as it is on big screen, especially seated on front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience, and much better than just on video.Affable aspiring cartoonist Hoops McCann (a wonderfully engaging performance by John Cusack) and his best buddy George (the deliciously deadpan Joel Murray) go to Nantucket for the summer following graduation from high school. Hoops, George, and several newfound pals come to the aid of Cassandra (Demi Moore at her most charming), a singer who\\'s family house is being threatened with demolition by the greedy Beckersted clan. Writer/director Savage Steve Holland offers an often hilariously wacky and zesty nonstop barrage of admittedly broad and dumb, but still very funny jokes. The constant madcap lunacy has a real giddy, good-natured and infectiously inane vitality to it that\\'s impossible to either dislike or resist. Moreover, the lively and enthusiastic acting from a fine game cast adds immensely to the zany merriment: Bobcat Goldthwait as the spastic Egg Stork, Tom Villard as his goofy brother Clay, Curtis Armstrong as the sweet Ack Ack Raymond, Mark Metcalf as evil rich jerk Aquilla Beckersted, Matt Mulhern as the mean Teddy, Kimberly Foster as the fetching Cookie, Joe Flaherty as the gung-ho General Raymond, William Hickey as cranky Old Man Beckersted, Jeremy Piven as smug preppy bully Ty, and John Matuszak as hulking biker Stan. Isidore Mankofsky\\'s slick cinematography, the hip thrashy soundtrack, Cory Lerios\\' cool rockin\\' score, and the funky animation are all uniformly excellent. Single funniest scene: Egg in a Godzilla suit terrorizing a posh dinner party. An absolute hoot.I was half-dozing as I watched a late night selection of short films--but sat bolt upright from the first frames of \"I Shout Love\" and could not take my eyes away for its full, brief, perfect length. With incredibly assured pacing and performances, this film maintains its funny/sad/insightful tone throughout. The credits at the end went by so quickly and in such small type, I had to go online to find out the person responsible for this master work. What a pleasing surprise to see the name of Sarah Polley, a major actress who is too seldom seen.<br /><br />Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) turn in rich, touching performances as a couple in the throes of breaking up. As they work through a reprise of Tessa\\'s favorite moments from their time together, both actors reveal dimensions of their characters and their relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talents--and to the director/writer\\'s skills. The film creates a moving narrative with laugh-out-loud moments and caught-breath sorrow.<br /><br />\"I Shout Love\" is unquestionably one of the greatest and most memorable short films I ever expect to see. It has wit, heart and stunning originality. It matters.'"
